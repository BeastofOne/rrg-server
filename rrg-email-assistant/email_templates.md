## 1. Multi-family Properties

**Subject:** Multi-family Properties Available

**Body:**
Hey [First name or "there" if no proper first name],

My name is Jake Phillips and I'm with Resource Realty Group out of Whitmore Lake. You were pinged on a multi-family email blast not too long ago and things got kind of crazy. I wanted to circle back and make sure: were you able to get that list of off-market multi-family properties we have? If not, I can go ahead and send you the NDA for it. Just let me know.

If you'd rather talk over the phone, my direct line is (734) 896-0518. Please do not hesitate to reach out with any questions or concerns.

All The Best,

## 2. Parkwood Multi-Family (Ypsilanti)

### Version A: NO NDA signed / No direct inquiry

**Subject:** Parkwood Multi-Family in Ypsilanti

**Body:**
Hey [First name or "there" if no proper first name],

My name is Jake Phillips and I'm with Resource Realty Group out of Whitmore Lake. I got your information from Crexi when you checked out an 11 unit multi-family property we have listed in Ypsilanti, MI-- 1480 Parkwood Ave. It's a turn-key project at around a 6% cap rate as-is, or it can be a value-add project if you spend around $125K to add a third bedroom in 10 of the 11 units. We estimate that would boost your NOI by around an additional $40K to $50K per year, and push you to around a 9% or 10% cap rate.

If you'd like to check out more information, just let me know and I'll send over the OM so you can check it out. Alternatively, we also have some off-market properties that might be a good fit, depending on what you're looking for. They would require an NDA to be signed, so just let me know and I can send one over to you.

If you'd rather talk over the phone, my direct line is (734) 896-0518. Please do not hesitate to reach out with any questions or concerns.

All The Best,
Jake
